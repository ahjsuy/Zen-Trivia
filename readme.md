# Zen Trivia

## Introduction

This is a Trivia Web App that supports both singleplayer and multiplayer. I'm currently working on hosting it on Firebase, but it is available right now to be locally hosted. All trivia questions are sourced from [The Trivia API](https://the-trivia-api.com/).

## Prerequisites

To host this locally, you must first have React + Vite to launch the front end and ExpressJS to launch the backend server.

## Step 1 — Launch the ExpressJS server.

Locate the Zen Trivia directory and run this command in the terminal.

```line_numbers,js
npm run server
```

---

## Step 2 — Launch the React server.

Wait a few seconds for the express server to launch. Once it is up, open up another terminal in the Zen Trivia directory and run this command to launch the front end.

```line_numbers,js
npm run dev
```
